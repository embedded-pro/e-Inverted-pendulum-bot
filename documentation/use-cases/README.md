> **Specification scenarios.** The `.feature` files in this directory are the

## Why these live in `documentation/`

`integration_tests/features/` is *executed* — by `ctest --preset host` and by the SIL
job in CI. A scenario placed there without a matching step definition fails the build.
The components these scenarios describe do not exist yet, so the scenarios are staged
here, where they are specification rather than test code.

They are not inert. The release pipeline generates the requirements traceability matrix
from this directory, so coverage is measured on every release.

**Migration path**: when a component gains an implementation, move its `.feature` file
into `integration_tests/features/`, add the step definitions under
`integration_tests/steps/`, register them in that directory's `CMakeLists.txt`, and
extend `features-dir` in the traceability job to cover both locations. Scenarios move
one file at a time; nothing here needs to move all at once.

## Traceability

Each scenario carries the requirement IDs it verifies as **Gherkin tags** on the line
immediately above `Scenario:`:

```gherkin
  @REQ-CTRL-002
  Scenario: The robot recovers from a push
```

A scenario verifying several requirements carries one tag per requirement, separated by
spaces:

```gherkin
  @REQ-CTRL-005 @REQ-CTRL-006 @REQ-TUNE-001
  Scenario: The robot reports the strategies it offers
```

Tags rather than comments, because a tag is part of the Gherkin language rather than
inert text. Cucumber can filter on them, so once a feature file moves into
`integration_tests/features/` the scenarios verifying one requirement become a runnable
selection — `--tags @REQ-CTRL-002` — instead of something only the matrix generator reads.

The matrix is generated by the `embedded-pro/project-documentation` action, which
scans for `REQ-[A-Z]+-[0-9]+` tags in this directory. To regenerate it locally:

```bash
python3 -m project_documentation.generate_traceability_matrix \
    --requirements-dir documentation/requirements \
    --features-dir    documentation/use-cases \
    --output          traceability-matrix.md
```

**Current coverage: 84 of 84 requirements (100%).** A new requirement without a tagged
scenario shows up under "Uncovered Requirements" — treat that as a specification defect.

Two mechanical constraints on this directory, both imposed by the generator:

- Feature files must sit **flat** here; the generator does not recurse into
  subdirectories.
- A requirement ID is matched by exact text, so a typo in a tag silently drops
  coverage rather than failing loudly.
- The generator matches the ID anywhere on the line, so it reads `@REQ-…` tags and bare
  `REQ-…` text alike; the tag form is the convention here.
