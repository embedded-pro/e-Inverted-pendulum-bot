## Assumptions & Constraints

- **Constraint**: no dynamic memory allocation in runtime/embedded code paths.
- **Constraint**: application logic depends only on abstractions in `core/`, never on a concrete MCU.
- **Assumption**: a host build exists for off-target testing and simulation.

## System Overview

The project separates portable logic from hardware. Application entry points in
`targets/` wire a platform `Board` into reusable libraries from `core/`. Host tools
and BDD integration tests exercise the same `core/` libraries off-target.

    App[targets/example_app] --> Core[core libraries]
    App --> Platform[targets/platform_implementations]
    Tools[tools/example_tool] --> Core
    IT[integration_tests] --> Core
    Platform --> Infra[infra: embedded-infra-lib / hal]
```

## Component Decomposition

| Sub-component | Responsibility |
|---------------|----------------|
| core          | Reusable libraries (interfaces + implementations), no entry points |
| targets       | Application entry points and platform-specific board implementations |
| tools         | Host-side developer utilities that reuse core libraries |
| integration_tests | BDD specification of end-to-end behaviour |

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Repo
        Core[core]
        Targets[targets]
        Tools[tools]
        IT[integration_tests]
    end
    Targets --> Core
    Tools --> Core
    IT --> Core
```

## Interfaces & Contracts

### Provided Interfaces

| Interface | Direction | Purpose | Invariants |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Application entry point | provided | Boots the system and runs the main loop | Constructs platform before logic |

### Required Interfaces

| Interface | Direction | Purpose | Invariants |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Platform Board | required | Exposes peripherals to the application | No heap; portable across host/target |
